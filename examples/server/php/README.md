This starter is based on:

  - Seeder files (js) to set up MongoDB users

Send custom response messages:
   - ApiResponse (extends Illuminate\Support\Facades\Response) to quickly send json encoded response message, with adapted Http status codes, and even failed validation rules

Multi-device session:
   - Token : allow a user to login from multiple devices and track all his active sessions.

   - single config file: *app/config/social.php*
   - [Facebook] Authentication (sdk v4): Wrapper class to easily connect and retrieve info
